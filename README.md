# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It has a button to open the form to compose a tweet.
It checks to see that the tweet is 140 characters or less, but not empty. When the user clicks tweet,
the tweet posts immediately below with the user's avatar, handle, and username, as well as how long
ago the tweet was made, which updates with each new tweet.

The app also is responsive to different screen sizes, particularly at 1024px wide or larger.
